# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
  - In uniform randomness the probability of values inside it is same for all of them.
  - Noise will generate random value based on the previous value and only between 0 and 1.
- What changed in your understanding?
  - Chances of getting every value is almost same.
  - Random values also depends on some value not always but in some cases.
- What would you explain differently now?
  - Randomness is basically performing probability.
  - Noise is just a psudeorandom values.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
  - customize randomness.
  - How does actually map works in noise.
- What would you like to see one more example of?
  - small customized random values to generate movement.
  - Mapping the generated noise value to different set of values.
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
  - If we can generate random values based on our requirements with customization just by simply giving the higher chances to the value which we want to get. Then what customization actually does?
  - How it is actually calculating and generating the value when we place it in a map.

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:
- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- What is second random value for?
- what exactly happens if the second values is less than probability.
- What is actual work of the variable we are taking to increment it and placing it in noise.

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A noise generation by mapping with different values.
- A simple customized random value generation.

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because I learnt about different kinds of randomness.
